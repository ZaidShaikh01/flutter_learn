Things I've learnt from this project

1. PageView Builder... Can be used to add scroll left or scroll like tiktok Things
It uses the content in the list.. It is similar to the listview Builder.

2. Then we are saving the content in git repo so to make it a JSon file and use API
3. We are using DIO package to make communication between api

4. Using Switch widget to switch betweent the pages

5. Created methods of provider so that it can br accessed as gloabal variable
6. stored the value in the global variable
